# RemoteControlledObjectDetection
This project's aim is to create an effective and intuitive system for detecting objects where users are not required to touch physical objects but instead make use of their bodies to achieve interaction. This project was created by me for an assignment in the Interactive Software &amp; Hardware (CS5041) module at the University of St Andrews.
